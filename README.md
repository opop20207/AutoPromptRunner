# AutoPromptRunner

AutoPromptRunner is a local-first prompt orchestration tool. It sends a prompt to a
coding agent, captures the agent's output, generates the next prompt, and decides
whether to continue. All state, logs, and configuration stay on the local machine; no
remote service is required to run it.

The CLI runs a bounded prompt loop, persists run history to a local SQLite database,
gates each generated next prompt behind an approval by default, supports reusable
project profiles, and captures the Git state around each step (read-only) so every run
records what changed. Three providers are available: `mock` (offline, deterministic),
`claude-code` (the real Claude Code CLI), and `codex` (the real Codex CLI). There are no
third-party runtime dependencies
(standard library only).

## MVP Workflow

```
User command
  -> create run
  -> capture git status (before)
  -> execute agent prompt
  -> capture git status / diff / changed files (after)
  -> generate next prompt
  -> wait for approval or auto-run
  -> repeat until done, failed, stopped, or max-loops reached
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- No third-party runtime dependencies (standard library only)
- For the `claude-code` provider: the Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated
- For Git artifact capture: the `git` CLI (optional; skipped when absent or non-repo)

## Prompt Loop and Approval Gate

A run executes one step at a time. After each successful step the `PromptGenerator`
produces a deterministic next prompt. By default the run pauses at `WAITING_APPROVAL`
with a PENDING approval; `--no-approval` auto-runs up to `--max-loops`. `max_loops` is
a hard bound, so the loop can never run forever. Status follows
`CREATED -> RUNNING -> WAITING_APPROVAL -> DONE / FAILED / STOPPED`.

## Next-prompt generation

The next prompt is produced by a **rule-based** generator -- it calls no external AI
APIs and uses no network. It chooses an outcome-specific prompt from the step context
(root prompt, previous prompt, stdout, stderr, exit code, loop index, max loops, the
changed files, and the git diff stat):

- **Success with changed files** -> review the changed files, run/improve tests, do the
  next smallest task, do not expand scope.
- **Success with no changed files** -> check whether the task is already complete and
  make only the next smallest concrete change if needed.
- **Failure with stderr** -> fix using stderr as the primary source, do not expand
  scope, re-run, and report remaining blockers.
- **Failure without stderr** -> diagnose from stdout and workspace state and make a
  minimal fix.
- **Test-failure output** (traceback, AssertionError, "failed", pytest/unittest, ...)
  -> fix the failing tests first while preserving intended behavior.
- **Many changed files** -> review the broad changes, reduce scope, and check for
  accidental modifications.
- **Final loop** (`loop_index + 1 >= max_loops`) -> wrap up: summarize work and list
  remaining tasks; do not start large new work.

Generated prompts are compact and actionable and contain no invented file paths or test
results. Add `--show-next-prompt` to `run` or `approve-next` to print the full generated
prompt instead of only the compact preview:

```
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli run --prompt "Continue next task" --max-loops 3 --show-next-prompt
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli approve-next --run-id 1 --show-next-prompt
```

## Persistence

Run history is stored in a local SQLite database (standard-library `sqlite3`). By
default it lives at `.autoprompt/autoprompt.db`; the parent directory is created
automatically. Pass `--db-path <path>` to any command to use a different location.
Tables: `projects`, `settings`, `runs`, `steps`, `approvals`, and `artifacts`.

## Project profiles

A project profile stores reusable run settings (repo path, provider, max loops,
approval, timeout) so you do not pass them on every run.

```
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli project add \
  --name FactoryColony --repo-path /path/to/FactoryColony \
  --provider claude-code --max-loops 5 --timeout-seconds 1800
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli project list
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli project show --name FactoryColony
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli project set-default --name FactoryColony
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli project delete --name FactoryColony
```

Run using a project's settings, or the default project when `--project` is omitted:

```
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli run --project FactoryColony --prompt "Continue next task"
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli run --prompt "Continue next task"
```

Settings resolve with precedence: explicit CLI args > selected `--project` > default
project > built-in defaults (`mock`, max-loops 1, timeout 1800, approval on). For
`claude-code`, the workspace comes from the project's `repo_path` unless `--workspace`
is passed. Deleting a project profile removes only the stored settings; it does **not**
delete the repository or any files on disk, and clears the default if it was default.

## Git artifact capture

When a run's workspace is a Git repository, each step records read-only Git artifacts:

- `git_status_before` and `git_status_after` (porcelain status around the step),
- `git_diff` and `git_diff_stat` (what changed),
- `changed_files` (the list of changed/untracked paths),
- plus `runner_stdout` and `runner_stderr`.

Git capture is strictly **read-only**: the tool runs only `git status`, `git diff`,
and `git rev-parse`, and a denylist rejects any mutating subcommand (add, commit,
reset, checkout, clean, push, pull, merge, rebase, ...). It never stages, commits, or
otherwise changes the repository.

A non-Git workspace (or no workspace, e.g. the `mock` provider) is allowed: the run
does **not** fail, Git artifacts are skipped, and a compact `git_skipped` warning
artifact is recorded instead.

List a run's artifacts, then print one in full:

```
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli show-artifacts --run-id 1
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli show-artifacts --run-id 1 --type git_diff
python -m autoprompt_runner.cli show-artifact --id 1
```

`show-artifact` exits non-zero with a clean error if the artifact id does not exist.
`show-run` also prints each step's changed files and diff-stat summary when available.

## Claude Code provider

The `claude-code` provider runs the real Claude Code CLI as a subprocess.

- **Requirement:** the Claude Code CLI must already be installed and authenticated.
  AutoPromptRunner does not install it and never handles API keys.
- **Example:**

  ```
  python -m autoprompt_runner.cli run \
    --prompt "Review this project and suggest the next smallest implementation task" \
    --provider claude-code --workspace /path/to/project --max-loops 1
  ```

- **Workspace:** `--workspace` is required for `claude-code` and must be an existing
  directory (or supplied via a project's `repo_path`).
- **Timeout:** `--timeout-seconds` (default 1800, >= 1) bounds the subprocess; timeouts
  and a missing `claude` command are captured as clean non-zero results.
- **Approval gate:** identical to the mock provider.
- **Safety warning:** Claude Code may create, modify, or delete files inside the
  workspace. Point `--workspace` only at a project you intend Claude Code to change,
  ideally one tracked in version control.

## Codex provider

The `codex` provider runs the Codex CLI as a subprocess, using the same provider adapter
model as `claude-code`. All Codex-specific CLI details are isolated inside `CodexRunner`.

- **Requirement:** the Codex CLI must already be installed and authenticated.
  AutoPromptRunner does not install it and never handles API keys.
- **Example:**

  ```
  python -m autoprompt_runner.cli run \
    --prompt "Review this project and suggest the next smallest implementation task" \
    --provider codex --workspace /path/to/project --max-loops 1
  ```

- **Workspace:** `--workspace` is required for `codex` and must be an existing directory
  (or supplied via a project's `repo_path`). Codex runs in non-interactive execution
  mode (`codex exec`) inside that directory.
- **Timeout:** `--timeout-seconds` (default 1800, >= 1) bounds the subprocess; timeouts
  and a missing `codex` command are captured as clean non-zero results.
- **Approval gate:** identical to the mock and claude-code providers.
- **Safety warning:** Codex may create, modify, or delete files inside the workspace.
  Point `--workspace` only at a project you intend Codex to change, ideally one tracked
  in version control.

## Runner Providers

| Provider | Class | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mock` | `MockRunner` | Available | Deterministic, offline runner used for tests and dry runs. Default provider. |
| `claude-code` | `ClaudeCodeRunner` | Available | Runs the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess inside a workspace. |
| `codex` | `CodexRunner` | Available | Runs the Codex CLI as a subprocess inside a workspace. |

## Tests

Standard library only; the Claude Code subprocess is faked and Git artifacts use
temporary repositories, so no real `claude` is needed:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
